# odin-admin-dashboard
Build a full dashboard, replicating a given design

The project is a full dashboard, replicating a given design. The design is a simple one, with a sidebar and a main content area. The sidebar has a logo, a list of menu items, and a footer. The main content area has a header, a list of cards, and a footer.

The main purpose is to practice CSS Grid (and Flexbox) and to build a responsive layout.
